# Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation using Deep Learning

This project presents a deep learning pipeline for brain tumor analysis from MRI scans. It includes two core components:

- **Tumor Detection:** Binary image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Tumor Segmentation:** Multi-class pixel-wise segmentation using a 2D U-Net architecture.

## üß† Datasets Used

- **Tumor Detection:**  
  [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)  
  Contains 2D grayscale MRI slices labeled as `tumor` or `no tumor`.

- **Tumor Segmentation:**  
  [BraTS 2020 (Preprocessed)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data/data)  
  Provides 2D slices with 4 MRI modalities and corresponding segmentation masks for:
  - Enhancing Tumor (ET)
  - Tumor Core (TC)
  - Whole Tumor (WT)

| Precision    | High (see report) |
| Recall       | High (see report) |
| F1-Score     | High (see report) |

### üîπ U-Net Tumor Segmentation

| Tumor Region       | Dice Score | IoU Score |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|
| Tumor Core (TC)    | 0.99       | ‚Äî         |
| Whole Tumor (WT)   | 0.91       | ‚Äî         |
| Enhancing Tumor (ET)| 0.86      | ‚Äî         |
